# Pathfinding Algorithms

This project contains implementations of graph-based pathfinding algorithms on weighted graphs:

- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**: Finds the shortest path based on edge costs.
- **A* Search**: Finds the shortest path using a heuristic to speed up exploration.

The code includes:
- Graph and node structures with parent tracking for path reconstruction.
- Support for geographic coordinates and travel-speed-based heuristics.
- Utility functions to compute path costs.
