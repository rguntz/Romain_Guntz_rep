# Master's and Personal Projects

This repository contains a collection of my Master's and personal projects, showcasing work in algorithms, robotics, optimization, and autonomous systems.  

## Projects Overview

- **Backgammon (Tavli) Algorithm**  
  Implementation of a backgammon game algorithm coded in C.  

- **Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Robots**  
  Coursework projects focusing on motion planning and control for autonomous robots. Includes:
  - **Searching Algorithms**: Techniques for pathfinding and navigation.
  - **Dubins Car Model**: Planning paths for vehicles with constrained turning radius.
  - **Markov Decision Processes (MDP)**: Modeling robot navigation as a sequential decision-making problem. The robot chooses actions to maximize long-term rewards while accounting for uncertainties in the environment.
  - **Rocket Landing Optimization**: Successive Convexification (SCvx) approach for rocket landing, including slack variables to avoid collisions with obstacles like walls.
  - **Autonomous Vehicle Trajectory Planning**: Frenet-frame optimal trajectory generation using quintic lateral and quartic longitudinal polynomials, with dynamic obstacle avoidance via polygon-based collision checking and adaptive speed control in crowded traffic.
 
- **Computer Vision**  
  Project from the Computer Vision Class (Prof. Dr. Marc Pollefeys).
  - **Harris Corner Detection and Feature Matching** This project implements Harris corner detection and feature matching between image pairs using hand-crafted descriptors (image patches).
  - 

    

## Notes

- Most projects are implemented in Python and C.
- The repository is structured by course/project for easy navigation.
